# 🏠 My Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles powering my Linux dev environment — clean, fast, and riced just the way I like it.

- 🔮 **Neovim** – fully modular, plugin-rich config built from scratch  
- 🌀 **Hyprland** – dynamic tiling Wayland WM with animations and flair  
- 🖌️ Theming – GTK, icons, rofi, wallpapers, and more for a cohesive look  

## ⚙️ Tools & Extras
- Fzf, Bat, Ripgrep, Tmux, and other CLI essentials
